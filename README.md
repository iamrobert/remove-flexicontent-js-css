# remove-flexicontent-js-css
### Remove css + js from frontend that FLEXIcontent automatically puts into the frontend template
### Remove css + js from RSFORM that RSFORM  automatically puts into the frontend template 
jcc-js-css-control (https://joomla-extensions.kubik-rubik.de/jcc-js-css-control) - 
is my favorite way to remove additional js/css calls - so I decided to modify it to work on removing 
FLEXIcontent CSS/JS + RSFORM - that I didn't ask to be put into my /template/ index.php file.

1. Install jcc-js-css control
2. Overwrite the two files in plugins/system/jscsscontrol/
3. Enable/Disable FLEXIcontent in the system plugin
4. Remove RSFORM in the system plugin
