# remove-flexicontent-js-css
### Remove css + js from frontend that FLEXIcontent automatically puts into the frontend administrator

jcc-js-css-control (https://joomla-extensions.kubik-rubik.de/jcc-js-css-control) - 
is my favorite way to remove additional js/css calls - so I decided to modify it to work on removing 
FLEXIcontent CSS/JS - that I didn't ask to be put into my index.php file.

1. Overwrite the two files in plugins/system/jscsscontrol/
2. Enable/Disable FLEXIcontent in the system plugin
